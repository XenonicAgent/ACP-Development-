        <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an
        extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be
        domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.</p>
